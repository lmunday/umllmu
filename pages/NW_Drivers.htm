				Question: Are there drivers anywhere in the world, who are more 
				ignorant than those in Washington state?<br />
				<br />
				Most drivers throughout the world need to concentrate on 1) 
				brakes, 2) steering wheel, 3) clutch and gears, 4) indicators 
				and 5) accelerator, in that order. in addition they may be 
				operating windscreen wipers, radio/cd player, windows, lights, 
				seat adjustment, seat belt.<br />
				<br />
				Drivers in the Washington state have the following list of 
				things to concentrate on in this order; 1) cellphone, 2) coffee, 
				3) McDonald's, 4) makeup/nose hair 5) windscreen wipers, 6) the 
				above, less the clutch (no-one drives a manual here).</div>
			<div>
				<br />
				This is a list of some of the worst driving habits that you will 
				experience in this state:<br />
			</div>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li>White lines in the road - these apparently serve no 
					purpose. Lines marking pedestrian crossings have cars parked 
					on them, lines indicating bike lanes have cars driving in 
					them, lines indicating lanes in the road have cars 
					straddling them. Waste of paint really. </li>
					<li>Stop signs - are often accompanied by a white line in 
					the road .. the line indicates where you are supposed to 
					stop .. it will always appear adjacent to the stop sign. If 
					the line is not there you should draw an imaginary white 
					line adjacent to the stop sign, and stop on it. Apparently 
					no-one explains to Washington state drivers that it is the 
					front of the car that is supposed to be stopped on this 
					line, not the rear of the vehicle. Apparently stop signs are 
					interpreted as 'Stop somewhere near here' in Washington.
					</li>
					<li>Reverse gear - cars in Washington state apparently have 
					only the one gear - 'drive'. Ask the driver to put their 
					vehicle in reverse .. they'll have no idea what you are 
					talking about. </li>
					<li>Driving on the highway - apparently we do not drive on 
					the right in Washington state. We drive 'in the middle'. If 
					in doubt drive in the lefthand lane just to be sure. The 
					right hand lane of the highway is to be used for entering 
					and leaving the highway only. Something I've experienced 
					many times on a 3-lane highway. I drive in the right hand 
					lane (I don't know if this is legal, but I have not been 
					caught yet). I also drive pretty fast, there are few cars 
					that will pass me on a highway. So I often find myself 
					coming up fast behind a car that has found itself in the 
					right hand lane, by accident. Sometimes the driver might 
					just have their rear view mirror facing the road (as opposed 
					to their nose, mouth, makeup, whatever part of their face 
					they were last fixing in the car), and they happen to look 
					up and see me coming. What do they do - they move into the 
					centre lane so that I am not inconvenienced into having to 
					switch lanes in order to overtake them So considerate these 
					Wa. state drivers. </li>
					<li>Overtaking - Don't! If you find yourself alongside 
					another vehicle in your right hand lane, drive at the same 
					speed as that vehicle for as long as possible. It's 
					dangerous to go faster than the car on your inside. </li>
					<li>Changing Lanes - Again don't do it in Washington, it is 
					dangerous and confuses the other road users. A manouevre 
					you'll often see on a Wa. state highway is a car following 
					behind another car in the centre lane. Even though there are 
					no other vehicles in either left or the right lane, if the 
					vehicle in front slows down the car behind will brake. They 
					will make no attempt to change lanes in order to avoid 
					braking. A game you can play when driving down the highway 
					goes like this. The speed limit is 70mph on most of the 
					highway. Drive the speed limit in the centre lane. 
					Eventually you will pick-up a follower, who will be driving 
					at the same speed as you behind you. Let them ride along for 
					a few miles until they get comfortable following you. Pick a 
					number between 10 and 70. Gradually take your foot off of 
					the accelerator. The number you picked represents speed at 
					which the following car finally decides to change lanes in 
					order to get around your car. Whoever got closest is the 
					winner. (Hint: Pick a number below 50 in order to stand a 
					chance of winning.)<br />
					</li>
					<li>Indicators - Do not advertise your intentions to other 
					road users, it only serves to give them an advantage over 
					you. We all know of someone who doesn't use indicators .. in 
					Wa. state you are lucky if you know someone who does.<br />
					</li>
					<li>Parking on the sidewalk and pedestrian crossings - this 
					is legal so long as there are no parking spaces on the road.
					</li>
					<li>Turning left - apparently steering wheels in Wa. state 
					have a turning angle of no more than 5 deg to the left. This 
					means that in order to make a 90 degree left turn you need 
					to start turning your wheel about half a mile before you 
					reach the junction. If you happen to be sitting at the 
					junction on the opposite side of the road you can witness 
					cars cutting across the front of you into your left hand 
					lane, then to the next lane etc, all way to the curb before 
					they manage to straighten out.<br />
					</li>
					<li>Turning right - in Canada I learnt that you may turn 
					right on a red light. Canadians know that if they are 
					waiting on a light to go straight ahead, it is polite to 
					pull over to the left side of the road to allow someone who 
					might be turning right to go through the red light. 
					Apparently in Wa. state this is illegal and you should pull 
					over to the right as far as possible in order to prevent 
					other drivers from breaking the law. </li>
					<li>Merging - when you see a sign warning that your lane is 
					coming to an end, in say the next 5 miles, it is important 
					to pull over to an adjacent lane immediately. If there 
					happens to be a vehicle in the adjacent lane, you must stop 
					and wait for a gap to appear hence causing a tailback for no 
					apparent reason. The number of times I pass cars on the 
					inside because they are trying to merge into traffic, yet 
					there is still 100 yards of tarmac left in their lane. Why 
					do Wa. state drivers go into panic mode when they are forced 
					to change lanes?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;To this end I recommend the Washington state driving test is 
				amended to add the follow manouevres:</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Pulling up to a stop sign - ensure that the whole vehicle is 
				past the stop line before it comes to a complete stop. </li>
				<li>Overtaking - if a vehicle is close to your rear, moving into 
				another lane to allow them to pass. </li>
				<li>Making a left turn - with only using one hand and not 
				turning the wheel more than 5deg in either direction. </li>
				<li>Making a phone call - while the car is in motion, 
				demonstrate that you can dial 10 digit number with using only 1 
				hand and press 'talk'. </li>
				<li>Coffee test - demonstrate an emergency stop, while drinking 
				a Starbucks, without spilling the coffee. </li>
				<li>Navigate the bicycle lane - drive for the length of the 
				road, with one half of the vehicle in the bicycle lane at all 
				times. </li>
				<li>Parking - park completely across the pedestrian crossing 
				preventing anyone from entering or leaving the road via the 
				crosswalk. </li>
				<li>Merging - Come to a complete stop, get out of your vehicle. 
				Flag down any cars in the lane into which you are trying to 
				enter until they come to a complete stop. Now get back into your 
				car and drive into the adjacent lane.<br />
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				Where else in the world do you see driving instructions on the 
				side of the road. All along the freeways, you will see signs 
				that state 'Keep Right Except To Pass'. Does anyone in 
				Washington state read these signs, or is it that the 
				instructions are just too complicated to follow?</div>
			<p>More to follow .. </p>
