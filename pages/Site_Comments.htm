		<p class="style10">I recently took a course on agile development with 
		Scrum, through Construx here in Bellevue. [Construx are generously 
		offering to fill up to 20% of their classes for free, to people that are 
		unemployed and have recently been laid-off.] Some of the lessons I 
		learnt from the class that I am considering adding to the process are:</p>
		<ul class="style5">
			<li style="height: 72px" class="style9">
			<p class="style11">Time-boxing - Scrum's alternative to an iteration 
			is a sprint. The main difference between a RUP iteration and a 
			sprint is that whereas an iteration encompasses the development 
			activities that lead to a stable, executable version of the product, 
			a sprint is a development effort performed over a fixed period of 
			time culminating in a release of the product. In order to achieve a 
			stable release we cannot guarantee the length and effort that goes 
			into an iteration. In a sprint, the time to finish is guaranteed, 
			but the content of the resulting deployment cannot be predicted for 
			certain. If we remove the clause that an iteration must result in a 
			stable release, then we could time-box RUP's iterations.</p>

		<ul>
			<li style="height: 72px">
			<p class="style11"><span class="style9">The PBI - Every product 
			development team has a prioritized list of items affecting the 
			product or a Product Backlog of Items list. A PBI may be of any form 
			that causes work for the product team. For example, requirements, 
			change requests, issues or even design and test changes. I would 
			like to see a similar concept </span><span class="style8">explicitly</span><span class="style9"> 
			described for each discipline, with a roll-down effect from Business 
			Modeling through to Deployment. Say a change request comes from the 
			business, this is added to the business modeling backlog. When the 
			BA has addressed this change an item is added to the Requirements 
			backlog. The systems analyst addresses the item in their backlog and 
			adds an item to the implementation application backlog. Similarly, 
			the designers add to a Test backlog and testers create Deployment 
			backlog items. These are prioritized between the two teams at the 
			time of being added to the backlog (this is different to Scrum, 
			which prioritizes items at the beginning of each Sprint).</span></p>

		<ul>
			<li style="height: 72px" class="style9">
			<p class="style11">One of the things this course, not so much taught 
			me, but re-enforced, is a concept that I have been trying to get a 
			handle on for almost as long as RUP has been around; is the idea 
			that we do not build a product and release it to our customers, then 
			go build another product, but even if using a waterfall SDLC, we 
			release a product to the customer and then have to continue 
			maintaining it for the duration of its life. Iterative methods, like 
			RUP and Scrum, take that concept and embrace it, by planning for 
			many releases of the product up front. (Waterfall generally plans 
			for a single 'big-bang' release.) In the early days of RUP, I 
			remember a conversation between two people who now both work for 
			IBM, where one was asking 'Where is the Maintenance phase of RUP'. 
			Sometime later the answer came back, it is there, during maintenance 
			you start another iteration of the whole process. As someone brought 
			up on waterfall, it's been a long journey, but I finally believe 
			that I grasp the idea that we never finish a product, we 
			continuously build the product until we kill it.</p>
